      <div id="terms">
         <p>
         <h3>Terms and Conditions:</h3>
         1. Account Information: When you sign up for online banking, you will need to provide certain information
         about yourself and your accounts. This information will be used to verify your identity and authorize
         transactions.
         <br>
         2. Security: We take the security of your online banking account seriously and use various security measures
         to protect your information, including encryption and firewalls. We also recommend that you take steps to
         protect your account, such as using strong passwords and not sharing your login information.
         <br>
         3. Transactions: You can use online banking to view your account balances, transfer funds between accounts,
         pay bills, and make other transactions. Some transactions may be subject to fees or restrictions, and we may
         require additional verification for certain transactions.
         <br>
         4. Mobile Banking: You may also be able to access your account through a mobile app or mobile website.
         Mobile banking is subject to the same terms and conditions as online banking.
         <br>
         5. Alerts: You can sign up to receive alerts for certain account activities, such as when a transaction is
         made or your balance falls below a certain amount.
         <br>
         6. Service Fees: We may charge fees for certain services, such as wire transfers or overdraft protection.
         These fees will be disclosed to you before you complete the transaction.
         <br>
         7. Termination: You can terminate your online banking account at any time by contacting customer service. We
         may also terminate your account if you violate our terms and conditions or engage in fraudulent activity.
         <br>
         8. Disclaimer of Liability: We are not responsible for any losses or damages resulting from the use of
         online banking, including unauthorized access to your account. You are responsible for monitoring your
         account activity and promptly reporting any unauthorized transactions.
         <br>
         9. Changes to Terms and Conditions: We reserve the right to change these terms and conditions at any time.
         We will notify you of any changes and you will be bound by the revised terms and conditions if you continue
         to use online banking.
         <br>
         10. Governing Law: These terms and conditions are governed by the laws of the state where the bank is
         located. Any disputes arising from the use of online banking will be resolved through arbitration in
         accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
