# Online Banking Website

This software development project involves the creation of an online banking website. It started by gathering requirements from the client(Supervising Dr and Teaching assistants in our case) to understand what features the website should have and the problems it seeks to solve. Afterward, the team designed the system, focusing on the main requirements needed, in the system design phase. 

The design phase included designing the database system of an online banking system using an erd then a relational schema. The team then moved to come up with the components in a component diagram and finally a class diagram where we had the chance to show the hierarchy of the system and the involved classes and interfaces. Design patterns were also used to solve problems. For instance, the observer pattern was used for notifications, and the facade pattern was used for transaction making, which needs many subfunctions to execute.

Finally, The frontend prototype was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The team also came up with a name and color palette to present a nice interface that can be accessed through this link that we deployed to https://main--credit-egide.netlify.app/. 

## Components

The online banking website frontend prototype has several components that work together to provide users with a seamless experience. These components include:

-client for client interface

## Conclusion

The online banking website frontend prototype is an example of a successful software development project that involved gathering requirements, designing the system, and developing a prototype. The use of design patterns helped to solve different problems encountered during the development process. The final product is a user-friendly website that provides users with a seamless banking experience.
